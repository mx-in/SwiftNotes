//: A while loop performs a set of statement until a condition becomes false.

    * while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass throught the loop.
    * repeat-while evaluates its condition at the end of each pass throught the loop.

//repeat {

//: ## Switch

/*:
 * break is not reauired in Swift.
 * The body of each case must contain at least one executable statement.
